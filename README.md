# Web Inventory System

## D287 â€“ JAVA FRAMEWORKS

This university project was an opportunity for me to implement user interfaces and learn to leverage existing frameworks, assets, and content for object-oriented programming.

Through it, I was able to:

* Migrate a "legacy" ecommerce backend to customizable inventory system used for different industries

* Add built-in purchase, min-max boundary features, and Thymeleaf views

* Improve the application by implementing ConstraintValidator classes and adding JUnit testing
